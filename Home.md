# Girl Life - English Community Version #


This is game is based on the Russian game ЭТО by DeGross, played in [QSP](QSP). On 8/4/15 the original game development came to and end and since then both Russian and English-speaking players have taken it upon themselves to expand the game. The English Community Version originally started as a translation project, but soon became a game on its own with its own unique content (while also implementing new events from the Russian versions).
