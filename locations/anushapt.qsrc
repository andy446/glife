Nush had helped me until she got bored and started running ''round as usual trying to find trouble... I think she was about eight at the time." He shakes his head in amusement as he remembers it.'
		'"As usual," you reply as a smile spreads across your face. Eduard gives you a relatable look, "So all of a sudden she disappears somewhere. I remember her playing around with my jacket. Before you know it I hear the car start and off it goes! With Nush sitting in the drivers seat and a huge grin on her face it''s driving towards the garage door on the opposite side..."'
		'You gasp as he continues. "Don''t worry I got her to stop. I am yelling at her to stop and she hits the brakes. She manages to stop less than a meter from the other garage. I don''t know how she was able to reach the pedals while being able to see over the dashboard. Anyways, I''m pissed and I yank open the door to really lay into her. However, she is sitting there all sad. She knows she did something wrong and she looks up at me with those big puppy eyes...," he says sighingly, "I couldn''t do anything as my anger just melted away. I just pulled her out and got in the car to back it back into the garage."'

The way he says police he sounds like he wants to spit the word. " Anyways... one of my friends found her out near the palace. We still don''t know how she got there. When he brings her back I asked what the hell she was doing and why she went off..." he sighs, "She just shrugged her shoulders and said that she felt like exploring the town... turns out my friend said she was conning tourists out of sweets then giving them bad directions. Apparently, she thought it was funny. That is until she got sick from eating to many sweets after I took her home. She threw up all over the place."'

She spent all her time on it for awhile and always wanted the newest games for it. Anyways, some the kids from the neighborhood had talked about this new game that was just about to get released, so, of course, she comes running and asks for me to buy it..."'
		'"Quite spoiled," you reply as you smile. Eduard gives you a relatable look, "Here comes the best part, so I tell her that we can''t afford it right now. At first she pouts, but quickly stops and disappears from the room. She never was much of a pouter. After about 30 minutes, we hear the door slam shut and the house goes really quiet..."'
		'You smile as he continues, "So what did my dear daughter do? Well, she took her little brother down the street and was trying to sell him for the same price as that game cost. Luckily a neighbor walked passed and had the two of them follow her home. This was after she promised that she would think about buying Maksim."'

As calmly as you please, she explains if she sold him I wouldn''t have to pay for the game. Since we wouldn''t have to feed him then we would have more money for more games." He shakes his head laughing. "That''s when I knew she wasn''t just going to be trouble like most kids, but that she was to smart for her own good."'

She was mad he ruined her fun you see..."'
