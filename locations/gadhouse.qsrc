Since we were familiar with the area we all dispersed to our cherished spots and began gathering berries."'

It’’s was really a great spot and as I approached I noticed very large number of ripe strawberries.

All of a sudden I hear some rustling behind the bushes. I turn towards the sound, but I''m met with silence. I didn''t notice anyone but I still couldn''t get rid of the eerie feeling."'

He''s completely still and just stares at me. I got really scared and ran away screaming and crying towards my brothers. They tried to stop and calm me down, but I just kept on running. My brothers started running after me, trying to keep up. I could hear my oldest brother shouting to run towards the kolkhoz. You see <<$pcs_nickname>> long time ago we had central collective farms that were called kolkhoz, your grandma explains."'
					'"We were lucky that the farms were close to the forest and didn''t have to run through the woods for long. I kept looking back if this person was following us but there was no sign of him. We knew we were safe when we see the farmers belonging to the brigade. My brothers and I ran up to the foreman and explained to him what had happened. He immediately grabbed the phone and called someone. The other farmers reassured us that we were safe now. After we had calmed down we got sent home. Our mother met as at home, she fed us and comforted me."'

Apparently it was done by the same man that I came across in the forest. I didn''t know it then but before the war our area was prone to sabotage by infiltrators, and staying hidden was easy, as the territory is covered by forest, stretching all the way to the border."'
