The town of Pavlovsk is centered around the train station. There is an open air market near the train stations that is open year around, where many bargains can be found. The cafe where your mother works can also be found near the train station, catering to the visitors coming in by train. The downtown area has most of the businesses and some middle class housing, while the residential area is a mixture of houses and soviet era apartment blocks. Some of the wealthiest families live in houses near the park on the outskirts of town. While the poorest homes are found near the old industrial area where several old factories has long since been closed down, lay abandoned and are run down. The only factory that is still open is the G&M clothing factory which also has a local store front and a tailor that can adjust your clothing. The industrial area is now mostly a home to prostitutes and drugs dealers, it is not considered a safe area to walk around at night. Despite being a tourist destination the area is seen as fairly poor, without many jobs.'

When the school was built was state of the art, but as some years has passed it is starting to fall into disrepair. The old school is a shell of it''s former self and sometimes used by the students as a place to hang out.

Next are the jocks, the athletes, they are all into one or more sports and spend most of their time working out or playing sports.
