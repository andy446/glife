		'"Ma-m-maybe, it''s possible to redeem myself? Some way to improve?" you sob, trying to wipe away the tears.'

But you''ve made things more complicated for yourself. There''s a simple way to save face though. But we need something to raise your reputation all over again..."'
		'Tamara thinks out loud to herself, sucking on her glasses, not paying attention to you. The tears are still rolling down your cheeks, but you start getting back your composure! Aunt Tamara starts talking to herself again, silently pointing to the door.'

		'Tamara pauses for a short time, continuing to nibble on the earpiece and starts clicking her nails on the armrest. A couple of minutes later, that seem like an eternity, she finally looks at you.'
		'"Listen very carefully, I will not repeat myself. I''ve come up with a way how you can redeem yourself. But for someone like you this might be very hard!" She starts while you fully focus on her. She stands up and continues...'
		'"First and foremost. From now on, you''re going to behave as a nun. You should avoid sex unless for education purpose... No more of that generous attitude to having sex everywhere, the disco, in parks, not even in school! You are forbidden to have sex with anyone in Pavlovsk. The only people you can even consider having sex with are the people closest to you, those who you can fully trust. You have to strictly maintain the good girl reputation in Pavlovsk."'
		'"If you really find it unbearable and have to let off some steam, go to the city. There''s a club there. Or you can go somewhere else where you can meet someone. If nobody knows you, you can have sex however you want and without harm to your reputation. The main thing is that you don''t forget to use protection or people will know and then not even I can help you."'
		'"And finally." Tamara claps her hands. "Time for a lesson. What''s the quickest way to orgasm?"'
		'"By having anal sex..." you quickly answer without thinking, instantly regretting your answer.'
		'"Come here!" Tamara sternly tells you...'
	elseif zz_stage = 4:
		'She makes you take off your panties, bending you across her knees. She then proceeds slapping your butt over and over again...'
		'You try to endure because you deserve it. But Tamara doesn''t stop after a few slaps, she continues slapping your ass harder and harder, leaving your poor butt with a burning sensation, hurting like hell. You start squealing more loudly with each slap. At the end, you can''t handle it anymore and you start crying hard. The spanking immediately stops.'
		'"There, there, baby, don''t cry. Come on, stop, I admit, I was filled with anger and got carried away, I may have overdone it a little."'
		'Sobbing, you try to pull the panties over your bruised ass. Tamara stops you, and pulls off your panties...'
		'"You won''t be needing them yet. You don''t have to be embarrassed, no one will see you here. Let''s go to my room, I have a lotion in my room that''ll help..." She takes you by the hand and leads you into her room.'
		'There, she grabs a bottle with some kind of lotion in it.'
		'"Now, lie down on the bed, and relax your cute little butt!" You lie down on Tamara''s bed. Her bed is quite modest and hard compared to the enormous, luxurious bed in Vicky''s room!'
		'Tamara carefully starts rubbing the pleasant-smelling ointment on your red, marked ass. And as she said, the burning sensation immediately begins to subside under the caress caressing hands of aunt Tamara. You have a hard time believing these are the same hands that just severely flogged you. "How can she snap so easily?" You once again start thinking about it...'
		'Her gentle hands continue caressing your back and feet, no longer focusing only on your butt, which already feels much better. You start enjoying yourself a bit too much. Your bare pussy starts getting wet! Without thinking about it you start moaning under the skillful caresses.'
	elseif zz_stage = 5:
		'Suddenly the caresses stop abruptly. You turn your head wondering why it stopped. Sitting on the bed next to you, you notice a completely nude Tamara, awkwardly cross legged, looking away from you...'
		'"I''m sorry, <<$pcs_nickname>>, I think I got a little carried away again... you''ve never seen me naked..."'
	elseif zz_stage = 6:
		'An impulse makes you take off your shirt and sit next to your mentor. You start caressing her magnificent breasts, touching her pink nipples with your fingers.'
	elseif zz_stage = 7:
		'Tamara moans, leans towards you, grabs you at the small of your back and pulls you in closer. She arches her back and throws her head back, like a big red cat, showing her smooth skinned neck.'
		'Your hands start gliding over her flawless skin. You kiss her exposed neck, continuing along the jaw line...'
	elseif zz_stage = 8:
		'You kiss her, gently nibbling her lower lip. While you kiss, you slowly slide your hand near Tamara''s pussy lips. You start circling your finger just inside her lips, being careful not to make contact with her clit.'
		'Getting wetter, Tamara pushes you on the bed and spreads your legs. She slowly circles her tongue just inside your lips, right on the edge. Slowly getting closer and then moving away, and then getting closer again teasing you...'
	elseif zz_stage = 9:
		'You let out a moan, and Tamara moves up your body kissing you. As she approaches your lips you move down a little, slowly making your way towards her chest. Nibbling on her breasts, you hear Tamara letting out tiny moans, wordlessly egging you on. You finally place your mouth around her nipple and gently start sucking them, making her gasp...'
	elseif zz_stage = 10:
		'Tamara, panting, begins to move down again. All of a sudden you gasp involuntarily and begin moaning louder as she flicks her tongue faster over your anus. While licking your anus she slowly slides a finger inside your wet hole. Overcome with ecstasy you tighten your pussy. She devours your delicious juices and slowly introduces another finger inside of you. As you start panting she increases the speed. You shudder as you start having what feels like never ending orgasms. You sure can learn a lot from her...'
	elseif zz_stage = 11:
		'Catching your breath, you thank your mentor. But there is no time for that. You slide a finger inside her feeling her pulsating pussy. Tamara pants harder and harder, you edge her several times. While sucking and nibbling on her pussy when you feel she can''t handle it anymore. She bends her knees, screams, and cums hard. You lick her clean after she orgasms. It looks like you''re a quick learner! She lays back after a few seconds, panting, with sweat coating her body. Tamara, satisfied, finally turns to face you saying...'
		'"Thanks <<$pcs_nickname>>! You have a real talent! Promise me you won''t waste it on those primates hanging out in the Park... They don''t deserve you..."'
